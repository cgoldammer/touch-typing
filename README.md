# Type faster

A tool to get faster at typing, available at [typing.chrisgoldammer.com](http://typing.chrisgoldammer.com).
The thought is that you want to use this tool to learn or get better at touch typing. Thus

- don't look at the keyboard
- focus on technique and correctness rather than speed. Speed will follow from good technique.

All completed levels are stored. Currently, I am only showing the results of the last few levels, but of course it's possible to add lots of statistics about your improvement

Feedback very welcome.

## Technology: 

* [Reflex-dom](https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex-dom) for the front-end logic.
* [PureCSS](http://purecss.io/) for CSS
* [Snap](http://snapframework.com/) for the back-end

## Next steps

- summary statistics for improvement over time
- the text adjusts dynamically and gets harder as you get better
- faster page load
